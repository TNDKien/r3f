# Interactive 3D Cube Experience

My first 3D web application built with React Three Fiber (R3F) and Next.js, featuring cubes with floating dodecahedrons and animated text. It is a simple project to learn the basics of R3F and Three.js and looks a bit like a mess.

## Features

- 🎲 Interactive 3D cubes with click and hover effects
- 🔄 Continuous rotation animations
- 🎯 Orbital controls for camera movement
- 🌟 Floating dodecahedrons with circular motion
- 📝 Dynamic text rendering on cube faces
